## Danner's Tech World

### Softaware Developer and Data Analysist

Hello, my name is Danner Taylor. I am currently working in the financial industry as a banker. Also, I am a co-founder, CEO, and CFO for a local tech company focusing on developing a hub for services. I decided to learn about software development to pivot my career from the traditional financial industry to a more fintech-oriented industry. I also want to better understand how our platform at the start-up company is being built; to be able to aport to the development. I plan to advance my technical knowledge in python to focus more on data and building webpages with dashboards. I believe that my new technical skills paired with my experience in the traditional financial industry will boost my career in the fintech industry.

I am excited about tech because it is a space where you can bring your imagination to live!
